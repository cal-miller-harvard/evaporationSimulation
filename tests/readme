Speed and correctness tests for the revamped collision_check function.

collision_check_compiled.py:
   - Compares the normal version of the function with the C++ extension
   - ../cpp/krbcollision.cpp defines the C++ extension for finding the collision pairs.
   - The extension should be built and installed (try "import krbcollision" in iPython).

collision_check_jit.py:
    - Compares the normmal version of the function with a faster version using
      Numba's just-in-time compilation
    - Needs Numba installed and Python 3
